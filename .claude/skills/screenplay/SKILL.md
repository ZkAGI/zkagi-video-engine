# Screenplay Writing Skill — 30-60s Video Scripts

## Copywriting Frameworks

### PAS (Problem → Agitate → Solve)
1. **Problem** — State the pain in 1 sentence. Make it personal.
2. **Agitate** — Twist the knife. Show why it's worse than they think.
3. **Solve** — Introduce the product as the obvious answer.

Example (PawPad):
- P: "Your crypto wallet has one key. ONE."
- A: "That's like locking your house with a paperclip and hoping for the best."
- S: "PawPad splits your keys across secure hardware vaults. Hack one? Cool, you get nothing."

### AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)
1. **Attention** — Shocking stat, bold roast, or "wait what?"
2. **Interest** — Why should they care? Analogy or story.
3. **Desire** — Show the transformation. Before/after.
4. **Action** — Clear CTA with energy.

Example (ZkAGI):
- A: "What if AI could think for you... without ever seeing your data?"
- I: "Right now, every AI app reads your prompts, your photos, your searches."
- D: "ZkAGI runs AI inside encrypted vaults. Your data goes in, results come out. Nobody peeks."
- A: "zkagi dot ai. Privacy isn't optional anymore."

## Hook Formulas (Scene 1 — First 3 Seconds)

### 1. The Roast
Attack the status quo. Make the viewer feel called out.
- "Bro, you're still storing your seed phrase in a NOTES APP?"
- "Your wallet security is literally a Post-It note and a prayer."
- "Congrats, you just made it super easy for hackers. Real generous of you."

### 2. The Shocking Stat
Lead with a number that makes them stop scrolling.
- "3.8 BILLION dollars stolen from crypto wallets last year. Yours could be next."
- "94% of wallet hacks happen because of one single key. ONE."
- "Every 12 seconds, someone loses crypto to a phishing attack."

### 3. The Question
Ask something they can't scroll past.
- "What happens to your crypto if your phone falls in a toilet?"
- "Would you trust a stranger with your bank password? Then why trust a single key?"
- "What if your wallet could protect itself... even from YOU?"

### 4. The "What If"
Open a possibility loop — they need to watch to close it.
- "What if AI could trade for you while you sleep... without ever touching your keys?"
- "What if losing your phone meant NOTHING for your crypto?"
- "What if the safest wallet on earth was also the easiest to use?"

### 5. The Controversy
Say something slightly spicy. Trigger a reaction.
- "Hardware wallets are security theater. There, I said it."
- "Your favorite wallet app is basically a glass safe. Everyone can see in."
- "Hot take: if your wallet needs 24 recovery words, it's already broken."

## Scene Pacing Template

```
Scene 1 — HOOK (3s, ~10-12 words)
  → Grab attention. Roast, shock, or provoke.
  → Energy: HIGH. Fast cut. Sound effect (scratch/bass-drop).

Scene 2 — TWIST THE KNIFE (8s, ~20-25 words)
  → Deepen the problem. Use analogy. Make them feel the pain.
  → Energy: Building. Visual shows the chaos/problem.

Scene 3 — THE SOLUTION (10s, ~20-25 words)
  → Introduce the product/feature. Keep it simple.
  → Energy: Relief. Visual shift to clean/hopeful.

Scene 4 — PROOF / DEMO (8s, ~15-20 words)
  → Show it working. Real demo clip or concrete example.
  → Energy: Confident. "Look, it actually works."

Scene 5 — CTA (5s, ~12-15 words)
  → Drive action. URL, hype, mic drop.
  → Energy: PEAK. End on a high. Sound effect (ping).
```

**Total: ~34 seconds of dialogue → ~45s with pauses/transitions**

For 60s videos, expand Scenes 2-3 to two scenes each (twist knife harder, explain solution deeper).

## Dialogue Rules

- **15-25 words per scene.** Not 10. Not 40. This range = 8-12s of TTS audio.
- **One idea per scene.** Don't cram two concepts together.
- **Conversational tone.** Write how you'd text a friend, not how you'd write an essay.
- **Use contractions.** "That's" not "That is." "You're" not "You are."
- **Active voice only.** "PawPad protects your keys" not "Your keys are protected by PawPad."
- **Concrete > Abstract.** "Your keys live inside a hardware vault" not "Enhanced cryptographic security."
- **Humor = specificity.** "Post-It note on your fridge" is funny. "Inadequate storage" is not.

---

## Humor Rules

### The Formula: Roast → Empathize → Solve → Hype

1. **Roast the problem** — Make it absurd. Exaggerate the stupidity of the status quo.
   - "Your wallet security plan is basically 'hope for the best.' Bold strategy."

2. **Empathize with the audience** — Show you get it. You've been there.
   - "Look, we've all been there. Sweating at 3am wondering if we wrote the seed phrase right."

3. **Solve with confidence** — Present the fix like it's obvious (because it is).
   - "PawPad splits your keys across three secure vaults. No single point of failure. Simple."

4. **Hype the CTA** — Make them feel smart for taking action.
   - "Stop gambling with your crypto. pawpad dot ai. Future you says thanks."

### Humor Techniques That Work:
- **Exaggeration:** "That's like putting your diamonds in a ziplock bag."
- **Callback:** Reference the roast from Scene 1 in the CTA.
- **Sarcasm:** "Oh sure, a 24-word phrase on a napkin. Super secure."
- **Bathos:** Build something up dramatically, then undercut it. "The most advanced... Post-It note in history."
- **Relatable scenarios:** "You know that panic when you can't find your phone? Now imagine there's $50K on it."
- **Rule of three:** "Fast, secure, and you don't need a PhD to use it."

### Humor Techniques That DON'T Work:
- Puns (cringe in short-form video)
- Self-deprecation (undermines product credibility)
- Inside jokes (alienates new viewers)
- Dad jokes (too safe, not engaging)
