# AI Image Prompt Craft Skill

## Prompt Structure Formula

Every image prompt should follow this order:

```
[SUBJECT] + [ACTION/POSE] + [SETTING/ENVIRONMENT] + [ART STYLE] + [LIGHTING] + [CAMERA/COMPOSITION] + [QUALITY BOOSTERS]
```

**Example:**
> "A nervous cartoon tiger clutching a giant golden key to its chest, standing in a dark alley with shadowy figures reaching from the walls, Pixar 3D render style, dramatic rim lighting with warm highlights, low angle hero shot, highly detailed, vibrant saturated colors, cinematic composition"

### Component Breakdown

**SUBJECT** — Who/what is in the scene? Be specific.
- BAD: "a person" → GOOD: "a nervous middle-aged man in a wrinkled suit"
- BAD: "a wallet" → GOOD: "a battered leather wallet with coins spilling out"
- BAD: "technology" → GOOD: "a glowing holographic cube floating above a desk"

**ACTION/POSE** — What are they doing? Static = boring.
- BAD: "standing" → GOOD: "clutching a golden key to their chest, eyes darting around"
- BAD: "holding a phone" → GOOD: "frantically tapping a cracked phone screen, sweating"

**SETTING** — Where is this? Ground the scene.
- BAD: "a room" → GOOD: "a dimly lit basement with exposed pipes and a single flickering bulb"
- BAD: "cyberspace" → GOOD: "a massive server room with glowing blue racks stretching to infinity"

**ART STYLE** — Pick from the style library below.

**LIGHTING** — Sets the mood. Always specify.
- Dramatic: "harsh rim lighting, deep shadows"
- Warm: "golden hour sunlight, warm ambient glow"
- Cold: "cool blue moonlight, clinical fluorescent"
- Cinematic: "volumetric light rays, atmospheric haze"
- Neon: "pink and cyan neon glow, reflective wet surfaces"

**CAMERA** — Composition matters.
- "low angle hero shot" — makes subject look powerful
- "bird's eye view" — shows scale and layout
- "extreme close-up" — emotion and detail
- "wide establishing shot" — sets the scene
- "dutch angle" — creates tension/unease
- "over-the-shoulder" — creates intimacy

**QUALITY BOOSTERS** — Always add 2-3.
- "highly detailed, sharp focus, professional illustration"
- "cinematic composition, depth of field, 8k quality"
- "vibrant saturated colors, artstation quality"

## Character-Driven Prompts vs Abstract Concepts

### The Golden Rule: Characters > Concepts

People connect with CHARACTERS in SITUATIONS, not abstract ideas.

**ABSTRACT (weak):**
- "blockchain security concept art"
- "privacy technology illustration"
- "decentralized network visualization"

**CHARACTER-DRIVEN (strong):**
- "a tiny person sitting inside a giant opaque crystal ball, curious onlookers pressing their faces against the outside trying to peek in, whimsical illustration"
- "a cartoon thief trying to break into a vault but the vault keeps splitting into three smaller vaults that run away in different directions, comic book style"
- "a sleeping person in pajamas while a robot in a suit makes trades on Wall Street, split scene, cozy bedroom vs chaotic trading floor, Pixar style"

### Character Prompt Templates:

**The Metaphor Scene:**
> "[Character] doing [unexpected thing] that represents [concept], in [setting], [style]"
> "A chef cooking with a blindfold on, perfectly plating a gourmet meal without seeing the ingredients, warm kitchen setting, Pixar 3D style"
> (Metaphor for: AI processing data without seeing it)

**The Contrast Scene:**
> "[Character A] in [bad situation] vs [Character B] in [good situation], split composition, [style]"
> "Left side: a stressed person drowning in paper keys and passwords, dark chaotic room. Right side: same person relaxing in a hammock with a single glowing card, bright sunny beach. Split composition, comic book style"

**The Reaction Scene:**
> "[Character] reacting to [event] with [emotion], in [setting], [style]"
> "A person's jaw dropping as their wallet transforms from a rusty lockbox into a sleek glowing vault, dramatic lighting from the vault illuminating their face, anime style"

## Quality Boosters That Actually Work

### Tier 1 — Always Include (pick 2-3):
- `highly detailed`
- `sharp focus`
- `professional illustration` / `professional photograph`
- `cinematic composition`
- `vibrant saturated colors`

### Tier 2 — Style-Dependent:
- `artstation quality` — for illustration/concept art
- `depth of field` — for cinematic/realistic
- `volumetric lighting` — for dramatic/moody
- `subsurface scattering` — for 3D renders
- `atmospheric perspective` — for landscapes/epic scenes

### Tier 3 — Avoid (diminishing returns or meaningless):
- ~~`8k uhd masterpiece`~~ — vague, clutters the prompt
- ~~`trending on artstation`~~ — doesn't reliably improve quality
- ~~`best quality, amazing`~~ — filler words, zero effect
- ~~`hyper-realistic ultra-detailed`~~ — pick one specific style instead

## Before/After Examples

### Example 1: Wallet Security Scene

**BEFORE (generic, lazy):**
> "digital wallet security, glowing blue shield, cyber background, futuristic"

**AFTER (character-driven, specific):**
> "a cartoon character nervously clutching an enormous golden key while shadowy hands reach for it from every direction, dramatic spotlight from above, dark alley setting, comic book art style with bold outlines, halftone dots, vibrant saturated colors, expressive panicked face, cinematic composition"

**Why it's better:** Character with emotion. Specific action. Specific setting. Specific style. Tells a story in one frame.

### Example 2: AI Privacy Concept

**BEFORE (abstract, meaningless):**
> "AI privacy technology, abstract data visualization, blue and purple"

**AFTER (metaphor-driven):**
> "a blindfolded robot chef in a spotless kitchen, perfectly slicing vegetables and plating an elegant meal without seeing any of the ingredients, ingredients floating in sealed glass containers around it, warm kitchen lighting, Pixar 3D render, soft ambient occlusion, whimsical, highly detailed"

**Why it's better:** The blindfolded chef IS the metaphor for private AI computation. Instantly understandable. Memorable. Fun.

### Example 3: Key Recovery Feature

**BEFORE (generic tech):**
> "data recovery concept, cloud storage, secure backup"

**AFTER (scenario-based):**
> "a person standing in pouring rain looking at their phone which just cracked on the ground, but a glowing holographic phoenix rises from the broken phone carrying a golden key upward, dark rainy street with warm golden light from the phoenix, anime style illustration with dramatic lighting, detailed rain particles, cinematic"

**Why it's better:** Emotional scenario (phone broke). Visual metaphor (phoenix = recovery). Dramatic and memorable.

### Example 4: Multi-Key Security

**BEFORE (abstract):**
> "three keys security system, digital protection"

**AFTER (humorous scenario):**
> "three tiny cartoon guards each holding one piece of a golden puzzle key, standing in front of three separate vaults on three separate mountain peaks, a confused thief at the bottom looking up at all three with a comically long to-do list, isometric perspective, Pixar style, warm golden lighting, whimsical and playful"

**Why it's better:** Shows the concept (3 keys, 3 locations) through characters and humor. The confused thief SHOWS why it's secure.

### Example 5: Trading Bot

**BEFORE (generic):**
> "AI trading bot, stock market, futuristic interface"

**AFTER (split-scene storytelling):**
> "split scene: left side shows a cozy bedroom with a person sleeping peacefully in pajamas hugging a pillow, right side shows a serious robot in a tiny suit frantically working multiple screens on a Wall Street trading floor, warm bedroom light vs cold blue monitor glow, Pixar 3D style, exaggerated expressions, cinematic split composition, highly detailed"

**Why it's better:** Tells the STORY of the feature (you sleep, bot trades) in one image. Humor from the contrast. Memorable.

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER default to generic cyberpunk neon.** If every scene looks like Tron, the video is visually monotonous. Vary styles across scenes.

2. **NEVER write abstract concept prompts.** "Blockchain technology" generates garbage. Always use characters, scenarios, or metaphors.

3. **NEVER forget the negative prompt.** Without it, you'll get text, watermarks, and deformed anatomy.

4. **ALWAYS vary art styles across scenes** in a single video. Scene 1 comic book, Scene 2 Pixar, Scene 3 watercolor = visual interest. All scenes same style = boring.

5. **ALWAYS include lighting direction.** Lighting is 50% of mood. "Dramatic rim lighting" vs "soft ambient glow" completely changes the feel.

6. **Match style to scene emotion:**
   - Hook (attention): Bold, high contrast, dramatic (comic book, noir, glitch)
   - Problem (pain): Dark, moody, chaotic (cyberpunk, noir, graffiti)
   - Solution (relief): Bright, clean, warm (Pixar, Ghibli, watercolor)
   - CTA (action): Energetic, vibrant, inviting (synthwave, pop art, storybook)

7. **Test with 768x512** for LTX-2 input images, **1344x768** for standalone images.
